You are likely viewing this because you have asked a question.
This is a sample project to illustrate points made in my response.
You can either run this from the commandline or an IDE that supports Gradle.

NOTE: Be sure to use the branch that I provided in my response.

== Running from the commandline

To run the sample application you must have a JDK 17+ installed.
Then you can run it using the following steps.

* Navigate to the folder on the commandline
* Execute

    ./gradlew bootTestRun

* Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser
* You will be redirect to a Spring Authorization server application that is started using https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-boot-testjars[Spring Boot TestJars]
* You can log in with user/password
* http://localhost:8080/login and http://localhost:8080/logout will not respond
* To stop the container use Ctrl-C from the commandline
