Instructions
=================

You are likely viewing this because you have submitted a forum question or a JIRA and this is a sample project to illustrate points made in my response. You can either run this from the commandline or an IDE that supports Maven (i.e. Spring Tool Suite).

Running from the commandline
---------------------------------

To run the sample application you must have a JDK installed. After doing so you can easily run the application using the cargo plugin. Specifically:

* Navigate to the folder on the commandline
* Execute

    ./gradlew bootRun 

* Open http://localhost:8080/amnything/addheader in your browser
* To stop the container use Ctrl-C from the commandline
